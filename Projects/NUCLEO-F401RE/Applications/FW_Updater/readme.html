<h2 id="-b-fw_updater-application-description-b-"><b>FW_Updater Application Description</b></h2>
<p>Application for the GNSS Teseo-LIV3F firmware updating.</p>
<p>Example Description:</p>
<p>This application must be used along with the java application FWUPG.</p>
<p>Plug the X-NUCLEO-GNSS1A1 expansion board on top of a STM32 Nucleo-F401RE.
Connect the STM32 Nucleo board to your PC.
Drag and drop FW_Updater-*.bin (in Binary folder) on Nucleo drive.
Run the java tool FWUPG.jar (in Utilities/PC_Software/FirmwareUpdaterTool folder).
From the java GUI, after selecting the right serial port, click Open to start a
connection with your STM32 Nucleo and X-NUCLEO-GNSS1A1 boards.
If the FW version on the Teseo-LIV3F module is not the latest one, click the
Update FW &gt;&gt;&gt; button to start the firmware upgrading process.</p>

<h3 id="-b-how-to-use-it-b-"><b>How to use it?</b></h3>
<p>In order to make the program work, you must do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
after building.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open STM32CubeIDE (this firmware has been successfully tested with Version 1.15.1).
Alternatively you can use the Keil uVision toolchain (this firmware
has been successfully tested with V5.37.0) or the IAR toolchain (this firmware has
been successfully tested with Embedded Workbench V9.20.1).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Run the example.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Alternatively, you can download the pre-built binaries in &quot;Binary&quot;
folder included in the distributed package.</p>
</li>
</ul>
