## <b>A_GetPos Application Description</b>

Application showing how to enable the Assisted-GNSS feature supported by the Teseo-LIV3F device.

Example Description:

This application shows how to enable Assisted-GNSS feature (both Predictive and Real-Time 
type) supported by the Teseo-LIV3F device.
To this aim, the application needs to access the Internet and is customized for B-L475E-IOT01A1 
providing the WiFi connectivity. For more details about Assisted GNSS, please refer to AN5160: 
RxNetworks Assisted GNSS Server Interface Specification and UM2399: ST Teseo III binary image - 
User manual available at st.com.
In addition, this application shows how real time GNSS data received by the GNSS Teseo-LIV3F 
device can be displayed through a serial connection and a serial terminal on a PC. 
The cJSON middleware support is included to parse the messages coming from the Assisted-GNSS network 
provider.
The A_GetPos application is built on top of the FreeRTOS support introducing a task (consumer) to parse 
the messages (enqueued in a shared queue) coming from the Teseo-LIV3F device; and a task (listener) to 
parse commands coming from the serial terminal.
Furthermore this sample application shows three advanced features supported by the Teseo-LIV3F device:

 - Geofencing

 - Odometer

 - Data Logging
The development of the application includes contribution by APG Division.
The Teseo-LIV3F device sends via a UART (or I2C) interface the received GNSS data to the STM32 
microcontroller, hosted on the B-L475E-IOT01A1 board, according to the NMEA 0183 Version 4.0 protocol.
The user can decide at compile time the interface to receive data (setting the macro USE_I2C in file
gnss1a1_conf.h).
The user can enable a specific feature at compile time (setting the corresponding macro in file gnss_app_cfg.h).

This A_GetPos sample application is able to:

 - establish a serial connection between the B-L475E-IOT01A1 and X-NUCLEO-GNSS1 boards and the PC

 - enable the Assisted-GNSS feature (both Predictive and Real-Time).

 - allow the user to select among different options for getting in a human readable format information related 
   to the acquired GNSS position, the satellites in view, the active satellites, and more.		
	
This A_GetPos sample application allows also the user to run commands enabling three advanced features:

 - Geofencing - allows the Teseo-LIV3F receiver to raise a NMEA message when the resolved GNSS position is 
   close to or entering or exiting from a specific circle

 - Odometer - provides information on the traveled distance using only the resolved GNSS position

 - Data Logging - allows the Teseo-LIV3F receiver to save locally on the flash the resolved GNSS position 
   to be retrieved on demand from the Host

After connecting the B-L475E-IOT01A1 board and the X-NUCLEO-GNSS1A1 expansion board and the multi antenna 
to the connector on the X-NUCLEO-GNSS1A1 expansion board, connect the B-L475E-IOT01A1 board to your PC.
Drag and drop A_GetPos*.bin (in Binary folder) on B-L475E-IOT01A1 drive.

Run a Serial Terminal (e.g. TeraTerm) on your PC and open a serial connection using the 
following parameters:

 - baud rate: 115200

 - data: 8 bit

 - parity: none

 - stop: 1bit

 - flow control: none

 - transmit delay: 5msec/char, 5msec/line

Reset the B-L475E-IOT01A1 board and select an option from the main menu appearing on Serial Terminal.

Preprocessor settings:
  Add in Compiler settings "USE_HAL_I2C_REGISTER_CALLBACKS=1" for I2C Bus ("USE_HAL_UART_REGISTER_CALLBACKS=1" for UART)

### <b>How to use it?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

 - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
   installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
