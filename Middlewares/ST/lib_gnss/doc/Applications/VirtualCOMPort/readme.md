## <b>Virtual_COM_Port Application Description</b>

Application for the GNSS Teseo-LIV3 mounted on an X-NUCLEO-GNSS1A1 
expansion board to be used along with the Teseo-Suite tool.
 
Example Description:

Plug the X-NUCLEO-GNSS1A1 expansion board on top of a STM32 Nucleo board.
Connect the STM32 Nucleo board to your PC.
Drag and drop Virtual_COM_Port_*.bin (in Binary folder) on Nucleo drive.
Run the Teseo-Suite tool (available on st.com) on your Win PC, select a Serial Port 
and open a serial connection through the Teseo-Suite GUI using the following parameters:
 
 - Baud Rate: 115200

 - Data Bits: 8

 - Parity: None

 - Stop Bits: One

and enjoy.    
For all info on how to use the Teseo-Suite, please, refer to the related documentation
available on st.com.

When using this application along with a serial terminal (e.g. TeraTerm) 
all messages coming from the GNSS Teseo-LIV3 are printed on the screen.

This application can run also on a STM32 Nucleo board equipped with a X-NUCLEO-GNSS2A1 expansion board (mounting the Teseo-VIC3DA device).
If the UART is used as communication bus between the STM32 MCU and the Teseo-VIC3DA the baud rate must be set to 115200 (it is 9600 between the STM32 MCU and the Teseo-LIV3F).

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32 Nucleo devices equipped with a X-NUCLEO-GNSS1A1 (or a X-NUCLEO-GNSS2A1) expansion board
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics:
    - NUCLEO-F401RE RevC board
    - NUCLEO-U575ZI-Q board
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

### <b>How to use it?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

 - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
   installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
   after building.
   
 - Open STM32CubeIDE (this firmware has been successfully tested with Version 1.9.0).
   Alternatively you can use the Keil uVision toolchain (this firmware
   has been successfully tested with V5.32.0) or the IAR toolchain (this firmware has 
   been successfully tested with Embedded Workbench V9.20.1).
   
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 
 - Run the example.
 
 - Alternatively, you can download the pre-built binaries in "Binary" 
   folder included in the distributed package.
