![latest tag](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/STMicroelectronics/x-cube-gnss1.svg?color=brightgreen)

The X-CUBE-GNSS1 is an expansion software package for STM32Cube. This software provides drivers running on STM32 for STM's Teseo-LIV3F GNSS device. This software package is built on top of STM32Cube software technology that ease portability across different STM32 microcontrollers.

**X-CUBE-GNSS1 software features**:

- Complete middleware to build applications using the Teseo-LIV3 device for positioning
- Easy portability across different MCU families thanks to STM32Cube
- Sample applications to read data received by the Teseo-LIV3 device mounted on the X-NUCLEO-GNSS1A1 expansion board
- Free user-friendly license terms
- Example implementation available for the X-NUCLEO-GNSS1A1 expansion board plugged on top of one NUCLEO-F401RE, NUCLEO-L476RG, NUCLEO-L073RZ or NUCLEO-U575ZI-Q

The figure below shows the overall architecture.
